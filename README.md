# README

Welcome to the code for my website. I fully understand that my website is essentially a vanity project, a portfolio of little games and gimicks -- most of which I developed while still in college.

Given the quartantine, I thought it prudent to revise and improve upon my site to reflect how much I've grown technically in the past few years.

Meanwhile, I understand that if I truly want a side project or anything to grow, it'll need to have it's separate site & repo anyway.

So, with that in mind, I'm cleaning up my old repos and shoving anything to do with my website in this monorepo.
