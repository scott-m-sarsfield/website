# README

Actually, don't read me. What are you doing?  This is a repo for a software engineer's vanity / portfolio website.  Most of this stuff was made in college anyway.  It's not up-to-date.  If there was a worthwhile project, it'd probably be in a separate repo.  

Ah, whatever.  Here's a cookie.
